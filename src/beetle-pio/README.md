# Orient-Beetle Firmware

This is the [platformio]-based project with the source code for the firmware
that runs on the [firebeetle] microcontroller board.

## Generating Fonts

The fonts used by the firmware have been "compiled" down from `.ttf` files
into lvgl-specific header files using the [fontconverter] tool provided by
the maintainers of that framework.

A mapping of characters to icons can be found in the [`mapping.md`][mm] file
located in the `.resources/Glyphter-font` directory at the root of this repo.
